  <!-- 1. POSITION / HOW TO READ THIS SITE -->
  <header>
    <h1>Yili Duan</h1>

    <p class="meta">
      Observing public culture, participation, and trust in real-world settings.
    </p>

    <p>
      This site is not a portfolio of outcomes, nor a chronological record of experiences.
      It is a collection of field-based observations about how people,
      responsibility, and public culture operate in practice.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am interested in how individuals learn, adjust, and become trusted
      in environments that do not primarily exist to support or train them.
    </p>
  </header>

  <!-- 2. FEATURED FIELDWORKS -->
  <section>
    <h2>Featured Fieldworks</h2>

    <p class="meta">
      Selected situations where my role was temporary, but responsibility was real.
    </p>

    <!-- Battle of Ideas -->
    <h3>Battle of Ideas — Worldwrite</h3>

    <p>
      This fieldwork confirmed that I can continue learning and functioning
      in unfamiliar, high-intensity environments without retreating.
    </p>

    <p>
      The experience was not framed as personal development.
      Responsibility was temporarily assigned rather than carefully cultivated.
      Trust emerged through preparation, reliability, and self-regulation.
    </p>

    <p>
      I observed how public cultural events rely on a large amount of invisible labour,
      and how learning often takes place under conditions that are efficient rather than gentle.
    </p>

    <!-- Hanbury Hall -->
    <h3>Hanbury Hall — National Trust</h3>

    <p>
      In contrast, this setting required emotional attentiveness and stability,
      particularly when working with children and families in shared public spaces.
    </p>

    <p>
      I learned how trust is built not through visibility or technical expertise,
      but through making others feel safe, understood, and at ease.
    </p>

    <p>
      These experiences shaped my understanding of responsibility
      as something relational rather than performative.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 3. HOW I WORK / HOW I OBSERVE -->
  <section>
    <h2>How I Observe & Learn</h2>

    <p>
      I tend to focus less on abstract argumentation
      and more on interaction, response, and situational dynamics.
    </p>

    <p>
      In public discussions, I often read the room through reactions,
      pauses, and shifts in attention rather than through complete argumentative arcs.
    </p>

    <p>
      In unfamiliar environments, I rely on asking questions,
      regulating my own expectations, and allowing space for error
      without withdrawing from responsibility.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 4. MOVEMENT / TRAVEL -->
  <section>
    <h2>Movement & Travel</h2>

    <p>
      When travelling, I tend to remember people encountered along the way
      and fragments of history shared informally,
      rather than destinations or landmarks themselves.
    </p>

    <p>
      These moments often reveal how cultural knowledge is carried
      through everyday interactions rather than formal narratives.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 5. BACKGROUND (LOW EMPHASIS) -->
  <section>
    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>
      My academic background informs how I approach observation,
      particularly in relation to media, culture, and participation.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, this site prioritises situated experience
      over formal credentials or chronological progression.
